# Hardware Exam Pratctical
 
I created a gun and boxing glove type controller using the initials "L" and "A". Early sketches are on the exam sheet I submitted.

The "L" is a gun that uses an arduino uno with a joystick, 3 LEDs, a speaker, and a trigger button. If the trigger button is pressed a sound will play and the LEDs will update with the current ammo count.

The "A" is a glove has 1 button and uses a micro:bit for the built in accelerometer to remain compact. I used a breadboard in the TinkerCAD simulator but since this is only 1 connection I would just connect the button straight to the board to save on space. The breadboard is not present in the Fusion CAD design.
